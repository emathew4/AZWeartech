    <string name="about_pemf_text">\tPulsed Electromagnetic Field (PEMF) therapy utilizes a wire coil
        in conjunction with a frequency generator to create a pulsed electromagnetic field.
        PEMF has been shown to reduce pain, increase bone healing, and also to treat depression.</string>

    <string name="about_tens_text">\tTranscutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) is the use
        of electrical current for nerve excitation. This non-invasive stimulation has been shown
        to reduce pain (both chronic and acute) by \"massaging\" the affected area. </string>
